Live Chat Overlay
=================

This CSS and JS turns the popout YouTube chat window into something that can be used to show chat comments keyed over a video.

[Setup Tutorial](https://youtu.be/HwctGtdsHZI)

## Installation

Install from the Chrome extension store:

* https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-chat-overlay/aplaefbnohemkmngdogmbkpompjlijia

Or you can install this as an "unpacked" extension. In Chrome, launch the Extensions page

* [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)

Then choose "Load unpacked", and navigate to this folder.

## Usage

Open up the YouTube live chat for a video, and click popout chat to open it in a new window. Or replace the `VIDEOID` in the URL below with your video's ID.

`https://www.youtube.com/live_chat?is_popout=1&v=VIDEOID`

You'll next need to bring that into your video stream and key it out, which will depend on what software or hardware you are using. In the ATEM Mini, you can use these settings in the upstream keyer:

* Luma key
* not premultiplied
* clip: 7%
* gain: 100%

Or you can use the downstream keyer:

* not premultiplied
* mask:
  * top: X
  * bottom: -9
  * left: -16
  * right: 16
